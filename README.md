This project is an application for a hypothetical engineering firm, Poised. The user fills in details related to the project such as name, physical address, ERF Number and other useful details, captures details of the customer, architect, and a contractor. The user is then allowed to change the due date of the project, the total amount of the invoice related to the project, and to finalise the contractor's details. 

Instead of writing and reading to text files as was the case in the previous Poised Engineering project. This uses the JDBC to connect to the SQL databse.
